# TODO

## Create a useful README
The code is approaching useful state, but needs to have the documentation
leveraged significantly.

## IPNS/IPLD

See if it makes more sense to post IPLD to IPNS for quicker more direct lookup, eg. foo := get /ipns/k7abcdegd/keyAgreement

## kub/rpc

go-ipfs-api has been archived and needs to be replaced with kubo rpc
