# TODO

## Create a useful README
The code is approaching useful state, but needs to have the documentation leveraged significantly.

## kubo/rpc

go-ipfs-api has been archived and needs to be replaced with kubo rpc

## Constant error messages.
Instead of parsing error strings low-level function should return ErrMessages. Eg. ErrKeyIPNSKeyExists, so that this error can easily be ignored by calling function.
