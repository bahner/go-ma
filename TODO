# TODO

## Create a useful README
The code is approaching useful state, but needs to have the documentation
leveraged significantly.

## IPNS/IPLD
See if it makes more sense to post IPLD to IPNS for quicker more direct lookup, eg. foo := get /ipns/k7abcdegd/keyAgreement
Update: You can get the entire document like this an Unmarshal directly back to struct,
but searching is not easy with go-ipfs-api. This will work better with kub/client/rpc, but that's much more complex.
KISS for now

## kub/rpc

go-ipfs-api has been archived and needs to be replaced with kubo rpc
